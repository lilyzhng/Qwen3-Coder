# Training Configuration for Qwen3-Coder-Next UI/UX Fine-tuning
# Last updated: 2026-02-07

# Model settings
model:
  name: "Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-Next-Base"
  max_seq_length: 4096  # Reduced from 8192 to save memory
  load_in_4bit: true

# LoRA settings
lora:
  r: 16
  alpha: 32
  dropout: 0.0
  target_modules:
    - q_proj
    - k_proj
    - v_proj
    - o_proj
    - gate_proj
    - up_proj
    - down_proj

# Training hyperparameters
training:
  learning_rate: 0.0002  # 2e-4
  num_epochs: 3
  max_steps: -1  # -1 means use num_epochs; override with --max-steps flag
  batch_size: 1  # Per-device batch size (reduced from 2)
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 8  # Effective batch size = 1 * 8 = 8
  warmup_ratio: 0.06
  weight_decay: 0.01
  lr_scheduler_type: "cosine"
  gradient_checkpointing: true  # Save memory by recomputing activations

# Optimizer
optimizer:
  type: "adamw_8bit"  # 8-bit optimizer to save memory

# Data
data:
  train_size: 100  # Number of training samples
  val_size: 10  # Number of validation samples

# Logging and checkpointing
logging:
  logging_steps: 1  # Log metrics every step
  save_steps: 4  # Save checkpoint frequently for testing (was 50)
  eval_steps: 2  # Run evaluation frequently for testing (was 25)
  wandb_project: "uiux-train"

# UI metrics callback
ui_metrics:
  enabled: true
  log_every: 1  # Log UI metrics (screenshots, entropy, etc.) every step
  render_screenshots: true  # Enable visual rendering with Playwright

# Hardware
hardware:
  gpu_type: "A100-80GB"  # Options: A100-80GB, H100, H200
  timeout_hours: 6  # Maximum job runtime
  max_retries: 1

# Notes:
# - Effective batch size = batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps = 1 * 8 = 8
# - With batch_size=1 and seq_len=4096, training should NOT trigger gradient offloading
# - Expected time per step: ~2-3 minutes (vs ~10-12 min with gradient offloading)
# - Total training time estimate: ~2-3 hours for full 3 epochs (39 steps)
